// Hi everyone! This is my first shot at app development, a basic calculator app that I made being a part of my college Coding Club. Hope you like it!

Steps: Ex: You want to add two nos. First take the two nos and add them using the "+" symbol. Since my logic is still a bit shaky, the code will only show the second no. From this point, do whatever steps and calculations you need to make using the second no. as your base.
