// Hi everyone! This is my first shot at app development, a basic calculator app that I made being a part of my college Coding Club. Hope you like it!

Steps: Ex: You want to add two nos. First take the two nos and add them using the "+" symbol. Since my logic is still a bit shaky, the code will only show the second no. From this point, do whatever steps and calculations you need to make using the second no. as your base. 

I am currently also working on an upgraded version for this app. It will have the following features:
- The bug (in step 3) will be removed
- Adding percentage, decimal point, logarathimic and more scientific functions
- Adding integration and differentiation
- Making it phone compatible with options for potrait and landscape rotation
- Better UI!

  Stay tuned for more updates!
