// Hi everyone! This is my first shot at app development, a basic calculator app that I made being a part of my college Coding Club. Hope you like it!

One bug I have: For your first value you are adding, don't directly put it. Do it as 0 + your value. Rest all arithematic can be done the same as a regular calculator

I am currently also working on an upgraded version for this app. It will have the following features:
- The bug (in step 3) will be removed
- Adding percentage, decimal point, logarathimic and more scientific functions
- Adding integration and differentiation
- Making it phone compatible with options for potrait and landscape rotation
- Better UI!

  Stay tuned for more updates!
